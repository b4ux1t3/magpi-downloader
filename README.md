This is a simple Python script which should run well on any Debian-based OS, but was designed on a Raspberry Pi.

You can change mirrors by changing the src and suf to whatever URL you want, but only if they use non-formatted issue numbers. (e.g. http://www.example.com/the-magpi-issue-1.pdf as opposed to /the-magpi-issue-01.pdf)
